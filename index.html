        <p><i>Founder and CEO <strong><a href="https://www.vanivrtti.com/">Vani Vrtti</a></strong></i></p>

        <p>Friends do come in all shapes and forms but Amlan definitely belongs to the latter category. A one-on-one with him will fill you with a sense of calm & self-worth. He is well read, well-travelled & can talk at breadth on any subject with
          ease.
          It’s this dynamism that makes him a great entrepreneur. His vision, faith in humanity & mastery in the art of common sense has taken Vani Vrtti to new frontiers; a modern-day luxury label in its true sense.
          After graduating with a Bachelor's degree in EEE, Amlan worked as an IT professional with Infosys. Although he thoroughly enjoyed coding, he realized that heartwarming success comes when you do something for greater mankind. His love for
          handloom
          grew right from his college days when he travelled for site visits to support Anupriya. He witnessed the hard work & dedication artisans and designers put into each saree. He took a leap of faith in 2019 and joined Vani Vrtti as its
          co-founder.
          His contribution to VaniVrtti's social platform, supply chain & guest relations made the brand what it is now. He remains guest-focused & looks for ways to enhance the brand's connections with its valuable patrons. To this day, he remains a
          loyal
          friend to many & Anu’s greatest cheerleader.</p>
